- Deployment: https://thence-assignment-mocha.vercel.app/ 


This project is a simple template for getting started with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast development server and bundler.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your local machine.
- npm or Yarn package manager installed.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/example/repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd project-directory
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` or the localhost being shown on your terminal Ctrl+click on it to view the application.

   Here's how you can include instructions for setting up Tailwind CSS in your README:

### Installing Tailwind CSS

To use Tailwind CSS in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies via npm or Yarn:

    ```bash
    npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    # or
    yarn add tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    ```

2. Generate a `tailwind.config.js` file:

    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss init
    # or
    yarn tailwindcss init
    ```

3. Create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your project and configure it to use Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      plugins: {
        tailwindcss: {},
        autoprefixer: {},
      },
    };
    ```

4. Create a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css` or `styles.scss`) in your project's `src` directory and include the following Tailwind CSS directives:

    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

5. Import your CSS file into your JavaScript entry point (e.g., `index.js` or `App.js`):

    ```javascript
    import './styles.css'; // or './styles.scss' if using SCSS
    ```

6. Now you can start using Tailwind CSS classes in your HTML templates or JSX components.

### Building Tailwind CSS

When building your project for production, you'll want to purge unused styles and optimize the output. You can achieve this by modifying your Tailwind CSS build command in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tailwindcss build src/styles.css -o public/styles.css"
  }
}
```

This command tells Tailwind CSS to build the `src/styles.css` file, purge unused styles, and output the optimized CSS to `public/styles.css`. Adjust paths as needed based on your project structure.

With these steps, you should be all set to use Tailwind CSS in your React Vite project! Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions.

## Commands

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the production-ready application.
- `npm run serve`: Serve the production build locally.
